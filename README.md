# 🏫 Energy Audit & Conservation Measures — E&TC Department, PICT

### 📘 Project Overview
This project presents a **Primary (Walk-through) Energy Audit** conducted at the **Electronics and Telecommunication (E&TC) Department**,  
**Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT)** during **A.Y. 2024–25**.  
It evaluates the department’s energy consumption, identifies major energy users, and recommends feasible **Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs)** and an **IoT-based energy monitoring system** for continual improvement.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Quantify the current energy consumption of the E&TC Department.  
- Identify **Significant Energy Users (SEUs)** and their contribution to total usage.  
- Propose **Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs)** to reduce consumption and cost.  
- Estimate potential savings and payback periods.  
- Suggest an **IoT-based Energy Monitoring System** for continuous tracking.  
- Align with **ISO 50001:2018 Energy Management System** standards.

### ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Pre-Audit Preparation** – Data collection from bills, layouts, and inventory.  
2. **On-Site Data Collection** – Measurement of loads (lights, fans, PCs, lab instruments).  
3. **Analysis & Calculations** – Energy usage estimation, SEU identification, and ECM proposal.  
4. **Recommendations** – Technical and behavioral solutions for energy efficiency.  
5. **IoT Integration** – Real-time monitoring and analytics dashboard design.

### 💡 Key Findings
| Equipment | Quantity | Annual Energy (kWh) | % of Total |
|------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| PCs | 232 | 101,616 | 74% |
| Ceiling Fans | 136 | 23,827 | 17% |
| Lighting (LED + Tube) | 131 | 10,804 | 8% |
| Misc. Loads | 25 | 1,102 | 1% |

**Total Annual Energy Consumption:** 137,349.5 kWh  
**Proposed Annual Savings:** ~30,088 kWh (≈22% Reduction)  
**Simple Payback Period:** ~1.8 years

### 🧠 Proposed Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs)
1. **PC Power Management** — Sleep/hibernate modes & shutdown scheduling.  
2. **Ceiling Fans** — Replace 60 W fans with 28 W BLDC (Atomberg) models.  
3. **Lighting Upgrade** — Replace old choke tube lights with LED tubes.  
4. **IoT-Based Monitoring** — Real-time tracking and alerting for abnormal usage.
